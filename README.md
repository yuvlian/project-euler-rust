# 1 Programming Language in 100 Problems
A repository that was inspired by [100 Languages 100 Problems](https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/100_languages_template/).

I thought to myself, why 100 languages? 

And of course, as your average elitist rustacean I went: 

> I must use Rust for all of this! Let's solve the first 100 Project Euler problems with Rust! The greatest language ever!!! Rahhh!!

Lastly, I'd like to give some thanks to [Project Euler Solutions](https://github.com/lucky-bai/projecteuler-solutions/) for providing the correct answers, making it possible for me to do assert_eq checks.
